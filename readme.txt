This is the first file in the Git Repository.
--------------------------------------------------

1. In order to create a repository navigate with the CMD to the folder of the 
project and run "git init" command.

2. In order to check the status of a file inside the project folder type 
"git status". This command will show the overall status of all the files
in the project folder.

3. To add a changed file to the repository type "git add <FILENAME>". To add
all files at once type "git add.". To commit a file or folder to the repository type "git commit -m <your message>".
Than you can see the differences with "git diff". To end that command type q or less.
